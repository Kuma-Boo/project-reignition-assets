Material name structure
all lower case with spaces
Add "common" if the texture is shared between multiple levels
type -> color -> specular

Join meshes that share the same materials to reduce draw calls
Export the level in chunks for interiors that can be manually culled

List of common materials shared between levels:

Collection Name -> (number type)
Sub Collection -> (number type)
Exported file -> (act-number-type.gltf)

Keep a backup of the materials outside the project. Importing new models that share materials seems to replace the textures.
